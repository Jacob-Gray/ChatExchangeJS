# ChatExchangeJS
A Node.js wrapper for the Stack Exchange chat system.

A demo can be seen in `demo.js`.

To run the demo, create a `user.json` file in the project dir, and add the bot username and password to it.

Then, just run `node demo`.

Your chat bot is now running in the [ChatExchangeJS Beta room](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/133210/chatexchange-js-beta) on stackoverflow.

###Note:
This project is still in development, and is missing key features. While it is functional, it may not be easy to use.

It is recommended to *not* use this lib in its current state for any serious project, but wait until the package comes out on NPM.
